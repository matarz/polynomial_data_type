{"name":"Polynomial Data Type","body":"![screenshot](http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/1552/20120424020345.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis project showcases an implementation of a [polynomial](http://math.about.com/library/weekly/aa030502a.htm) data type in C++. It allows addition, subtraction, comparison, assignment, and other operations on polynomials. The full list of operations are listed in the screenshot above. For that to work, there was a heavy use of operator overloading. A polynomial like this \"4x^2-3x^1+7\" would be treated as an object (lets call it \"p1\") that we can use the above operations on with a different polynomial. For example, if we had another polynomial \"p2\" we could add (i.e. p1+p2), subtract (i.e. p1-p2), compare, (i.e. p1>p2), or assign (p1=p2) the two polynomials like we would do with integer variables. Download the code and try it out yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can find the full assignment [here](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karlaf/CS202_Fall09/Prog3.html).\r\n","tagline":"A polynomial data type in C++","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
